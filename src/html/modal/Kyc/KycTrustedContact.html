    <div class="explain">
        A trusted contact is a person you authorize your financial firm to contact in limited circumstances,
        such as if there is a concern about activity in your account and they have been unable to get in touch with you.
        A trusted contact may be a family member, attorney, accountant or another third-party who you believe would
        respect your privacy and know how to handle the responsibility.
        The trusted person should be 18 years old or older.
