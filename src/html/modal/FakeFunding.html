        To use liminal.market you need some aUSD. aUSD is the same value as USD.
        We can give you some aUSD (this is all fake money), so you can play with the system.

        First, you need to add aUSD to you wallet.

        <button id="addTokenToWallet">Add aUSD to wallet</button>
        <blockquote id="needToCopy" class="d-none">
            If the button didn't work, you can copy the address here and import it into your wallet
            <input value="{{aUSDAddress}}"/>
        </blockquote>
        When you have aUSD to you wallet, you can request some money to trade with.

        <button id="requestFakeAUSD">Request some aUSD</button>
        <div class="warningBar notificationBar d-none" id="fundingError"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="afterFunding" class="d-none center">
        We have now sending aUSD to your wallet. This usually takes few seconds, so lets wait. Sometime
        when things are slow it can take few minutes.
<br /><br />
        When you have the aUSD in you wallet, we will tell you.
        <div>
            <h3>Current aUSD balance</h3>
